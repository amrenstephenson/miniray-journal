## Associated Project
This activity involved working on the collaborative project [MiniRay](https://github.com/Muirey03/MiniRay), which aims to be a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) ray-based rendering engine. The project was started by myself and fellow Durham Computer Science students, [@Muirey03](https://github.com/Muirey03) and [@MohammedMohsinAhmed](https://github.com/MohammedMohsinAhmed).
